With nearly 3-4 years of focused experience, I've honed my skills to craft advanced yet simplistic solutions, prioritizing efficiency and readability in my code.

Outside of the digital realm, I also excel as a small engine mechanic, specializing in older models such as Craftsman, AYP, and MTD units. My commitment and knowledge exceed my ability beyond programming.
